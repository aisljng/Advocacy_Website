    <!--- About --->
    <p> More than 80% of schools funding has been cut since 2008. As a result schools are forced to decide what aspects of education are deemed as more valuable. This has caused schools to cut arts from the curriculum meaning classes such as music, theater, dance, and all other art related classes are being put to the side or are being overall eleminted from schools. This is a problem because art is an essiential skill people need to create innovative ideas.
    </p>
